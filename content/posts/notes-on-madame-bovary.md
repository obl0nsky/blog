## Picking a translation

I was persuaded to select the Adam Thorpe translation after reading his [description](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/21/translating-madame-bovary-adam-thorpe) of the translation process and reading the following example prose:

> He arrived one day about three o’clock; everyone was in the fields; he entered the kitchen but failed to spot Emma at first; the shutters were closed. Through the cracks in the wood, the sun stretched out its long thin rays on the flagstone floor, shattering against the corners of the furniture and trembling on the ceiling. Flies were climbing the length of the glasses left on the table, and buzzing as they drowned at the bottom, in the cider’s dregs. The daylight that came down the chimney, giving a velvet sheen to the fireback’s soot, turned the cold cinders slightly blue. Between the window and the hearth, Emma was sewing; she wore no shawl; you could see on her bare shoulders tiny drops of sweat.
