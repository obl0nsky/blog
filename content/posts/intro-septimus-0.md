Every fortnight or so I shall review a computer science paper. I have named the series of posts _Septimus_ after the tutor in Tom Stoppard's _Arcadia_.

## Motivation
Writing about a subject is conducive to understanding it more deeply. Therefore, I hope that this sequence of posts will enable me to have a _deeper_ and _broader_ understanding of computer science as a whole.

Papers will be selected (pseudo-)randomly. I have no particular topic I would like to focus on. The paper will just be selected based on what I find interesting during aimless browsing, or papers that are recommended to me.

The intended audience for the posts is a version of me who has not read the paper and would like a technical adumbration without investing the additional time into reading all the relevant literature.
